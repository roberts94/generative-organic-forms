# Generative Organic Forms

This project aims to model an evolving system of cells that undergo mitosis and react with a variety of systemic and external forces. Implemented in Processing, it currently outputs a 3D mesh (.OBJ) of the particle system's state upon keypress. Inspiration for this project was drawn from "Digital Morphologies: Environmentally-Influenced Generative Forms" by Sage Jenson. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_4X5OQcV3d8Y3JYWFBpU1ZWbHM/view
