# Generative Organic Forms

This project aims to model an evolving system of cells that undergo mitosis and react with a variety of systemic and external forces. Implemented in Processing, it currently outputs a 3D mesh (.OBJ) of the particle system's state upon keypress. Inspiration for this project was drawn from [Digital Morphologies: Environmentally-Influenced Generative Forms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_4X5OQcV3d8Y3JYWFBpU1ZWbHM/view) by Sage Jenson.

### Initial State
The form begins as a collection of 20 [particles](particle.pde) **P**, each with a position **p** and normal **n** in **R^3**, along with a set of linked particles **L**. They are arranged into an [icosahedron](icosahedron.pde) with the particles as vertices and linkages as edges.
